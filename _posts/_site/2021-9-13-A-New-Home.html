<p>I’ve been cooking the change from blogger to a GitHub pages for a while. My <a href="https://thatantennaguy.blogspot.com">blog</a>, as well as my small personal projects, have been stalled for more than half a year now. Honestly, I don’t really know how to explain this absence and lack of time for anything. Somehow today I finally got the time and disposition to tackle this task and get back to do what should have been done quite a while ago. To setup my <a href="https://theantennaguy.github.io">personal page</a> on GitHub pages and migrate the content of my blog to my github pages.</p>

<p>Stay tuned, I’ll be making my next post hopefully during November… I hope!</p>
