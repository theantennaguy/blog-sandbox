title: Wireless Power Transfer - Some thoughts
draft: true
---

Alright, let's kick things off for 2023 with a new posts on an entirely new subject. I've been cooking this one for quite some time, but due to some unfortunate turn of events, I lost all the material I had for this post, including the text itself that was nearly finished - thanks OneNote. Therefore, I had to re-write all the text for this post and re-search images and sources again and everything from the ground up. That was a lot of trouble, but here it is, if anything I learned not to trust OneNote for keeping anything for long, and now when I store stuff there, I make sure to load into into a text file to my blog sandbox on GitHub as soon as possible.

This time I decided to write about Wireless Power Transfer. This interest kicked in due to an article coming out stating that ESA has finally lunched an interest call to finance projects concerning SBSP (Solar-Based Satellite Power).
